# LightNovel-Downloader

Hi. This is the second piece of code that I have ever written. I like reading lightnovels, but suffer when I have to go without internet connection for any reason, because then I can't load any new pages. This is a solution for that.

It downloads the paragraph content of the webpage into both txt and a pdf file. 

Obviously, it can be heavily upgraded, which is something I will work on soon. 

I faced issues with the font for the pdf compilation part. I will link the font below, you can get it from there directly. Personally, I added it directly to the fpdf folder in the python folder, by making a folder called fonts. You can do whatever you want, but you have to link the path to it. Alternatively, you could use preinstalled fonts in fpdf, but that didn't work for me.

the modules you might have to install if you have already are:
fpdf
beautifulsoup
