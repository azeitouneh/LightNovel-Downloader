# LightNovel-Downloader

Hi. This is the second piece of code that I have ever written. I like reading lightnovels, but suffer when I have to go without internet connection for any reason, because then I can't load any new pages. This is a solution for that.

It downloads the paragraph content of the webpage into both txt and a pdf file. 

Obviously, it can be heavily upgraded, which is something I will work on soon.
